NeuroCraft is a web application that allows users to craft their own neural networks without writing any code. This project includes both a frontend built with React and a backend built with Python & Pytorch.

## Usage
This web-app is **suited for deep learning beginners** to explore the fundamental of neural network such as **linear/dense layer**, **batch-normalization layer**, **activation function**, **drop out layer**, **train accuracy** and **test accuracy**. Datasets provided are basic datasets which are **Digit MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** dataset.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React and TypeScript. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite for bundling.

## Backend

The backend is built using Python and Flask. Framework used is PyTorch for NN Training. Also, the backend automatically saves the trained model.

## Next Progress
